# ü§ñ‚è© Synchronize Dev GitHub Action

This GitHub Action attempts to fast-forward the `dev` branch with the `master` branch. If it's unable to perform a fast-forward merge, it will create a new branch and open a pull request for manual review.

## Inputs

- `DEVELOP`: The name of the development branch. Default is `dev`.
- `BOT_NAME`: The name of the bot that will perform the operation.
- `BOT_EMAIL`: The email of the bot.
- `TOKEN`: The GitHub token. Please note that this token should have the necessary permissions to perform branch operations.
